## Set up payments
Please see [Learning OJS](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-distribution#payments) for how to enable payments. Ensure that you select **Paypal Fee Payment** as a **Payment Method**. After you select Paypal Fee Payment, fields will appear below for _*Account Name**, **Client ID**, and **Secret**_. Follow the instructions in the [PayPal documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/admin/manage-apps/#create-or-edit-sandbox-and-live-apps) to generate the credentials to enter into the OJS fields. Make sure to check off the box for Test Mode before saving.

Next, go to the [Subscriptions chapter](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/subscriptions.html) in Learning OJS 3 and follow the instructions to set up your payment types and subscription types, if applicable.

## Test Transactions 
On OJS set up a test transaction that you can use to test whether payments are being successfully processed. For this example, we will be using an Article Processing Fee.
You as the author will get a link to pay your Article Processing Fee. The link will first direct you to login to your OJS account followed by the [PayPal Sandbox website](https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/mep/dashboard ).

Using one of the fake PayPal accounts, make test payments to the site. The successful payment will then appear on sandbox of your main PayPal Account Overview:

The test transaction will also appear on the Payments page of your journal. 

### Troubleshooting Test Transactions
If your test transactions are not successful, please check the following: 
* API app is set on sandbox.
* OJS plugin is set to Test Mode.
* API credentials from the sandbox has been copied correctly to OJS.
