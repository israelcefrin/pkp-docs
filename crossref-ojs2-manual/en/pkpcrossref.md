# Project Information

PKP and Crossref are collaborating to help publishers and journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS) take better advantage of Crossref services. As of 2014, PKP has become a Sponsoring Organization of Crossref, and as such will be providing much improved Crossref integration and overall support for the service. Additionally, PKP can now act as a sponsor representative for OJS journals wishing to apply for Crossref membership, and is in some cases able to waive fees.

## DOI and Associated Metadata Export

PKP is working with Crossref to improve the level of overall DOI export support provided within OJS. OJS has included a basic manual export plugin for several years; this plugin will be extended in the following ways, and will be freely available to any journal using OJS (2.4.5+).

- automatic DOI deposit to Crossref on article publication (2.4.5);
- inclusion of other article metadata in the Crossref deposit, including author ORCID iDs; article abstracts; and more (OJS 2.4.5);
- inclusion of FundRef funding data (forthcoming);
- support for the CrossMark publication record service (forthcoming);
- and more.

## Future Development Plans and Milestones

The Crossref Export/Registration plugin is still undergoing active development. We intend to focus on the following enhancements from OJS 2.4.8 and, particularly, into the OJS 3.0 release.

-   UI/UX review of both the Public Identifier Plugin and the Crossref Export/Registration Plugin;
-   Add the option to check current DOI status (rather than simply the deposit status), for example whether DOIs are currently "live";
-   Extend the Crossref deposit XML to include abstracts; reference lists; and more;
-   FundRef; CrossMark additions
