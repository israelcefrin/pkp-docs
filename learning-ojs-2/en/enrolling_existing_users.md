# Enrolling Existing Users



Users already enrolled in the journal can be given additional roles, and users registered to the site with other journals (if you are working in a multi-journal OJS installation) can be enrolled with your journal. To do so, click on '**Enroll a User from this Site in this Journal**' from the Journal Management Page under Users, or click on '**Enroll Existing User**' from the 'Users Enrolled in this Journal' page. You will be provided with a list of all site-wide users.

This feature allows you to enroll an existing user into an additional role. For example, if Ted is currently registered as an author, but volunteers to become a reviewer, this feature will allow you to add that role to their profile. From the list of users, select **Enroll an Existing User**.

On the resulting page, use the dropdown menu to select the role and place a check next to the user's name. Hit **Enroll Selected User** to enroll that user in the selected role.
