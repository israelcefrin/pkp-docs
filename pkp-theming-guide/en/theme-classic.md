# Classic Theme

The Classic Theme should bring to mind classics and scholarship. It uses a serif typeface (Cardo) designed for “classicists, biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists,” and was inspired by the work of Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius. 

[This OJS site](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs3/demo/index.php/classic) demonstrates the Classic theme.

Classic features a block-based layout for an issue’s table of contents, which makes great use of larger screens. But it also collapses into a clean, accessible view for smaller screens. The theme comes with an arresting yellow as the default primary colour to bring energy to a traditional style, but you can choose whatever color fits your brand. 

Installation and configuration instructions are available in the theme plugin's [style guide](https://github.com/pkp/classic/blob/master/README.md).
