# Health Sciences Theme

The Health Sciences Theme is an official theme for OJS 3.1.1+ designed for health science journals or any journal that wants a clean, modern appearance. Using the contemporary and humanist typeface, Fira Sans, this theme was designed with cleanliness, simplicity and accessibility in mind. 

[This OJS site](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs3/demo/index.php/health-sciences) demonstrates the Health Sciences theme.

Installation and configuration instructions are available in the theme's [style guide](https://github.com/pkp/healthSciences/blob/master/README.md).
