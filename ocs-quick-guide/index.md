# OCS Quick Guide

- [English](en/)

Open Conference Systems (OCS) is designed to be a complete, multiple conference management system, including a full peer review component. However, many users do not have such requirements, and plan to only use the software for a single event, with "reviews" conducted by a small group of conference directors. This document will walk you through how to configure and use your OCS installation to meet those needs. If this is your first time using OCS, you will also want to have a copy of [OCS in an Hour](https://pkp.sfu.ca/files/OCSinanHour.pdf) available, as this document is not intended to replace that manual, but to provide some alternatives not covered within it.
